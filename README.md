# OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Learning Journey

This repository contains code examples that I've written during my journey of learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. I'm learning OOP principles practically using the Java programming language.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 1. Loops
- Basic loop structures
- Weekly lessons, homework, and laboratory exercises
- Practice questions and solutions

### 2. ArrayList
- ArrayList usage and data structures
- Collection operations
- List manipulation examples

### 3. Class and Object
- Class creation and object instantiation
- Practical applications with Customer, Product, and Student classes
- Getter/Setter methods and encapsulation

### 4. Inheritance

- Inheritance examples with Shape classes (Circle, Rectangle)
- Method overriding

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

1. Core OOP Principles
   - Encapsulation
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Abstraction

2. Java Programming Language
   - Basic syntax
   - Data structures
   - Object-oriented programming features

## 📚 File Structure

For each topic:
- 📂 Lesson notes (`lesson` folders)
- 📂 Laboratory work (`lab` folders)
- 📂 Homework (`homework` folders)
- 📂 Study questions (`studyQuestion` folders)

## 🚀 Development Process

This repository will be continuously updated and expanded as new topics are learned. It serves as a record of my OOP learning journey.

## 📌 Note

This repository was created to document my OOP learning process and track my progress. New topics and examples will continue to be added over time.
